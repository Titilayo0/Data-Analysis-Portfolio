# Customer Call Analysis
## Executive Summary
This project analyzes customer call data to derive insights into total number of calls, call durations, average rating, happy callers, agents rating, calls per week, and call durations. By examining key variables such as call duration, purchase amount, and satisfaction ratings, we aim to optimize customer service strategies and enhance overall customer experience.

## Project Objectives
Assess trends in customer satisfaction based on call interactions.
Identify correlations between call duration, purchase amount, and satisfaction rating.
Segment calls into meaningful categories using duration buckets.
Provide actionable insights to improve customer service operations.
## Project Scope
Timeframe: The dataset includes calls from multiple fiscal years (FY).
Data Coverage: The dataset captures essential customer service metrics, including call metadata, purchase details, and satisfaction ratings.
Analysis: Includes trend analysis, statistical summaries, and recommendations for improving customer service.
## Dataset Overview
The dataset contains the following columns:

Call Number: Unique identifier for each customer call.
Customer ID: Unique identifier for each customer.
Duration: Length of the call in minutes.
Representative: Name or ID of the customer service representative handling the call.
Date of Call: Date when the call took place.
Purchase Amount: The monetary value of purchases made by the customer during or after the call.
Satisfaction Rating: Customer satisfaction score (e.g., on a scale of 1-10).
FY (Fiscal Year): The financial year associated with the call.
Day of Week: The weekday on which the call took place.
Duration Bucket: Categorization of call durations (e.g., short, medium, long).
Rating Rounded: The rounded version of the satisfaction rating for easier analysis.
## Methodology
Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, standardize formats, and remove duplicates.
## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Summary statistics of call duration, purchase amount, and satisfaction rating.
## Trend analysis across months and weekdays.
### Segmentation:
Grouping customers based on call duration buckets.
Analyzing representative performance based on satisfaction ratings.
### Correlation Analysis:
Identifying relationships between call duration, purchase amount, and satisfaction rating.
### Visualization: Graphical representation of key trends and insights.
## Conclusion
The analysis provides insights into customer behavior, representative performance, and key factors influencing satisfaction. Findings can be used to optimize call handling times, improve representative training, and enhance customer service strategies.

## Recommendations
Optimize call durations: Identify ideal call lengths for higher satisfaction and efficiency.
Enhance training programs: Focus on representatives with lower satisfaction ratings to improve performance.
Strategic scheduling: Allocate more resources during peak satisfaction periods.
Targeted follow-ups: Engage with customers based on satisfaction trends and purchase behavior.
