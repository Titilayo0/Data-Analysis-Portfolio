# ðŸ§¾ Retail_Record Dataset: Data Preparation Summary

This project involves preparing and cleaning the `Retail_Record` dataset using Power Query to ensure it is consistent, accurate, and ready for analysis in Power BI.

##  Transformation Steps

### Source Connection and Navigation
- Imported the dataset and selected the relevant sheet/table.

### Header Promotion
- Promoted the first row to become the column headers.

###  Data Type Assignment
- Applied appropriate data types to each column (e.g., text, numeric).

###  Column Renaming
- Renamed columns to improve clarity and consistency (e.g., `Total Sales`).

###  Row Cleaning
- Removed unnecessary top rows containing non-data elements such as titles or spacing.

###  Unpivoting Columns
- Unpivoted columns to standardize the dataset into a long format for better aggregation and filtering.

###  Splitting and Reformatting
- Split a column by delimiter to separate compound entries into meaningful parts.

###  Filtering Rows
- Filtered out irrelevant or empty records to retain valid and complete data.

###  Final Data Type Adjustments
- Converted the `Total Sales` column to a currency type for accurate financial analysis and visualization.
